Description:
    This tree, in addition of being a ranked AVL tree, it supports ranges.
    Example: 
        add X for each node with Z <= K <= M 
        with O(log(n)) time complexity
        The wanted value should be the sum of extras from the node to the root.
To do:
    -add extra member in node
    -update rotations (need update?)
    -add functions:
        -getExtraSumFromRootToNode
        -updateRange(node i, node j)
    -update:
        -remove:
        -add:
